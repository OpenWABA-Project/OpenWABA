   - Include as much information as possible: description, reproduction steps, impact, and suggestion for fixes if possible
   - Indicate if and how you would like to be credited

3. **Response Time**: 
   - We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
   - You can expect a more detailed response within 7 days, including our assessment and expected timeline for a fix
